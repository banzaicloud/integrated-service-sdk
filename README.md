## Client SDK for the Integrated Service Operator

This library is a client SDK that defines the Kubernetes APIs (both code and generated CRDs with schemas) 
and some utilities to work with the Integrated Service Operator.

The Integrated Service Operator is a closed source component of [Banzai Cloud Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline),
which is the primary consumer of this library.

You can read more about the project's purpose in the following blog post:
